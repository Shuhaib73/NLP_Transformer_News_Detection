# News Detection Web Application: Trained Bi-LSTM & Word2Vec for Accurate News Categorization üì∞‚ú®

Welcome to the News Detection Web App! üåü Leverage advanced deep learning techniques to categorize news articles based on their content. This app uses a trained Bi-LSTM (Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory) model in combination with Word2Vec embeddings to deliver precise and context-aware classification of news articles. Whether you're analyzing news trends, filtering fake news, or categorizing articles into topics, this tool provides fast and reliable insights. üöÄ

## üìñ **Features**

‚úÖ **Advanced Emotion Detection**: Classify text into diverse emotions such as Happiness, Anger, Sadness, Fear, and Surprise, providing a deeper understanding of human sentiment.  

‚úÖ **Trined Bi-LSTM Model**: Built using Bidirectional LSTM, the model captures both past and future context in news sequences, improving classification performance for news content.

‚úÖ **Word2Vec Embeddings**: Uses Word2Vec, a pre-trained word embedding model, to transform words into vector representations, allowing the Bi-LSTM model to better understand word relationships and contextual meaning in news articles.

‚úÖ **Customizable & Scalable**: The modular architecture supports fine-tuning for additional emotion classes or integration with larger datasets.

‚úÖ **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with Flask, HTML and CSS, the interface ensures a smooth and intuitive experience for all users.  

‚úÖ **Deployable Anywhere**: Containerized with Docker for consistent performance across environments.
